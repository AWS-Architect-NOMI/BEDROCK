Project 4: Machine Learning Model Deployment with AWS SageMaker

Introduction

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning (ML) service that allows data scientists and developers to train and deploy machine learning models efficiently. This project will demonstrate how to prepare data, train a model, and deploy it using AWS SageMaker.

Architecture Overview

AWS SageMaker: Trains and deploys ML models.

S3: Stores training datasets.

IAM Roles: Ensures secure access.

SageMaker Endpoints: Hosts trained models for inference.

Step-by-Step Implementation

Prepare Training Data:

Upload your dataset to an S3 bucket:

aws s3 cp data.csv s3://my-dataset-bucket/

Set Up a SageMaker Notebook Instance:

Navigate to SageMaker > Notebook Instances > Create notebook instance.

Assign an IAM role with permissions to access S3.

Launch the Jupyter notebook interface.

Train a Machine Learning Model:

Use the SageMaker SDK to train the model:

import sagemaker
from sagemaker.sklearn.estimator import SKLearn

sagemaker_session = sagemaker.Session()
role = 'arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/SageMakerExecutionRole'

estimator = SKLearn(entry_point='train.py', role=role, framework_version='0.23-1', 
                    instance_count=1, instance_type='ml.m5.large', 
                    output_path='s3://my-dataset-bucket/output/')

estimator.fit({'train': 's3://my-dataset-bucket/train.csv'})

Deploy the Trained Model:

predictor = estimator.deploy(instance_type='ml.m5.large', initial_instance_count=1)

Test Model Inference:

response = predictor.predict([[0.5, 1.2, 3.3]])
print(response)

Achievement & Business Use Case

Achievement: Successfully deployed a machine learning model with SageMaker, demonstrating the ability to leverage AWS ML services for scalable AI solutions.

Use Case: Ideal for predictive analytics, fraud detection, and AI-driven automation across industries.
