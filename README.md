Project Name: AI-Driven Health Insights AWS BEDROCK Chatbot
Project Name: AI-Driven Health Insights Chatbot
1️⃣ Use Case & Business Need
At Philips, we aimed to enhance patient engagement and improve health insights by creating a chatbot that could summarize patient data and answer routine questions. The chatbot needed to:

Store large datasets (medical records, lab results) in S3 for scalability and cost efficiency.
Use AWS Lex for a natural language chat interface.
Leverage AWS Bedrock to generate AI-based summaries and respond to user queries with healthcare insights.
2️⃣ Architecture & Workflow
Data Storage (Amazon S3)

All patient records, lab reports, and analytics data are securely stored in S3 with SSE-KMS encryption.
Lifecycle policies ensure older data is moved to S3 Glacier for cost optimization.
Chat Interface (AWS Lex)

Users (patients or healthcare staff) interact with a Lex chatbot (e.g., a “HealthAdvisorBot”).
Lex parses the user’s intent (e.g., “Summarize patient lab results”) and triggers a Lambda function.
Generative AI & Summaries (AWS Bedrock)

The Lambda function calls AWS Bedrock to summarize or generate an AI-based response from the relevant patient data in S3.
Bedrock uses a foundation model (e.g., Titan) to produce human-like summaries of the patient’s data (lab results, medical history).
Response Delivery

The chatbot returns natural language answers to the user via Lex.
Key insights (e.g., “Patient’s vitals are stable; no critical flags”) are stored in S3 for auditing and compliance.
3️⃣ Why This Project Is Simple Yet Impactful
Serverless & AI: Combines AWS Lex (conversational AI) + AWS Bedrock (generative AI) + S3 (scalable storage).
Low Operational Overhead: No servers to manage; everything scales automatically.
Secure & Compliant: S3 encryption, IAM roles, and AWS KMS protect sensitive healthcare data.
Generative Insights: Bedrock transforms raw medical data into actionable advice or summaries.
Easy to Expand: Add new data sources or extended features (e.g., SageMaker for custom ML models).
4️⃣ Defending This Use Case in an Interview
Technical Depth: Highlights serverless best practices (Lex, Lambda, S3) and foundation model usage (Bedrock).
Practical Impact: Shows healthcare domain knowledge, delivering AI-driven insights for improved patient care.
Security & Compliance: Demonstrates HIPAA/GDPR alignment using S3 encryption, IAM identity policies, and AWS Key Management.
Scalability & Cost Optimization: S3 lifecycle policies, auto-scaling with Lex and Bedrock, and pay-per-use models keep costs in check.
